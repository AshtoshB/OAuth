IMPORTANT: When creating the OAuth client ID in Credentials, make sure the applicaiton type is Desktop 

Requirements:

   You need the following packages:
   
      1) Google.Apis.Auth :- Install-Package Google.Apis.Auth
      
      2) Google.Apis.PeopleServices.v1  :- Install-Package Google.Apis.PeopleServices.v1 
      
    For Google People Service you need the Google People API to be enabled in the Google Cloud Console
    
       Google Cloud Console -> APIS and Services -> Library -> Google People APi
       
As for the Client ID and Client Secret, it's hard coded into the demo app, so you can just replace it in Forms1.cs
